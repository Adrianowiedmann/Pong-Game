# OLED PONG GAME
Pong game made using a MSP430F5529 microprocessor.

## 1. About the Project
This project was carried out for the discipline of Laboratório de Sistemas Microprocessados at the University of Brasilia - UnB.

The porpuse of this project was to make the oled pong game using the language C and subjects studied in class for example: DMA, UART, ADC.

This project was made using Code Composer Studio.
